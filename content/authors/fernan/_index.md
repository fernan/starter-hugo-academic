I began my academic career at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) with a
degree in Biology in 1995. Then completed my PhD in 2001 working at the Luis
F. Leloir Institute – Fundación Campomar (UBA) on biochemistry and molecular
biology. The focus of his research was the metabolism of Echinococus
granulosus, a helminth parasite. For my postdoctoral work at the University
of San Martín, I focused on genomics and bioinformatics, working mainly with
protozoan and bacterial pathogens (trypanosomes, Brucella, Campylobacter).
My current interests are the identification and experimental validation of
drug targets against trypanosomes, and the use of high-throughput genomic
and proteomic platforms to study human immune responses against Trypanosoma
cruzi (Chagas Disease) to guide development of much needed diagnostic
applications. Over time my lab has used different strategic approaches
(experimental bench work, bioinformatics). I also have an interest in
teaching and training of human resources, and in the promotion of
Bioinformatics. I teach a Computational Biology and Bioinformatics course
and am a founding member of the Argentinian Society for Computational
Biology and Bioinformatics (A2B2C).
