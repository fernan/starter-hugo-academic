# About me 

Specialist in the computer analysis of large volumes of data with applications in biological or health sciences. Mainly focused on improving the diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease.
As my master degree thesis, from 2016 to 2018, i carried out an exhaustive analysis of high density peptide microarrays that allowed the discovery of new candidate antigens for the diagnosis of congenital Chagas. Currently a doctoral fellow CONICET-UNSAM, with a place of work at the IIBIO and with the prospect of graduating in 2023, under the direction of Dr. Fernán Agüero. 
Engineer in Agrobiotechnology, one of the first graduates in the UNSAM.
