# About me 

I am currently doing my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at the University of Hurlingham (UNAHUR). I work in Bioinformatics, using computer science and programming to analize chemogenomic information. I’m researching new compounds that might be useful to treat Chagas disease by using genome-wide data and chemical libraries at IIBIO-CONICET.
