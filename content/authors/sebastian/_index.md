# About me

I am currently doing a bachelor's degree in biotechnology at the National University of San Martín (UNSAM).  I am very enthusiastic about computer science as much as biotech, and pursuing a career in Bioinformatics.

My collaborations in the lab are related to software development, software architecture and data engineering. I'm looking forward to apply deep learning to use chemogenomic data for reposition of drugs in the context of drug discovery for neglected diseases. And in particular for Chagas disease for my bachelor's thesis.
