Our laboratory is interested in the study of human pathogens, particularly
trypanosomes and also others that cause so-called *Neglected Tropical Diseases*. 

We develop computational tools and produce (and re-use) large data sets to
formulate and guide our research hypotheses in the quest for new drugs and
diagnostics. Smart and intensive data integration, data mining,
and high-throughput assays and experiments are at the core of our research
activities.

In particular, we have a special interest in the study of trypanosomes such as
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ (causative of Chagas disease). 

Wellcome to our electronic home in the web. Feel free to browse and poke
