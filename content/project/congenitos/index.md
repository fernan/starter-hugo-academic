We are conducting antigen discovery in Congenital Chagas, mapping and validation for the development of a serological diagnostic kit for application in neonates.
For this, we develop computer algorithms that allow to exhaustively analyse a large amount of data generated with high density microarray peptides. Validation is performed in the FLISA platform.
