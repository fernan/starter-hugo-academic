## High content serology screenings

In the lab we use high-density peptide microarrays to discover new antigens, map their epitopes and to perform very fine epitope characterizations. This produces very rich data on human immune responses and their targets. Then, these antigens and epitopes are synthesized and used as reagents for the development of new immunoassays. 

## Next-generation diagnostic assays

Novel diagnostic reagents based on small peptides or recombinant proteins are produced in the lab, and validated for a number of applications: diagnosis of infection; as prognostic markers (to predict development of pathology); or as markers to followup treatments and cure.
