## Unraveling the antibody diversity in Chagas Disease using antigen microarrays. 

During an infection, the immune system produces antibodies against
pathogens. With time, the immune repertoires of infected individuals become
specific to the history of infections and thus represent a rich source of
diagnostic markers. We are using high-density peptide arrays to examine the human
antibody repertoires developed by Chagas Disease patients. The aim is to uncover the
diversity of recognized antigens and build an atlas of antigens and epitopes
for Chagas Disease.
