The volume of biological, chemical and functional data deposited in the
public domain is growing rapidly, thanks to next generation sequencing, and
highly-automated screening technologies. However, there is still a large
data imbalance between model, well-funded organisms and pathogens causing
neglected diseases (NDs). We developed a chemogenomics resource, (TDR
Targets, <a href="https://tdrtargets.org">https://tdrtargets.org</a>), that
aims to organize and integrate heterogeneous large datasets with a focus on
drug discovery for human pathogens. The database also hosts chemical and
genomic data from other organisms to leverage data for comparative and
inference-based queries. One of the major impacts of TDR Targets is to
facilitate target and chemical prioritizations by allowing users to
formulate complex queries across diverse query spaces.
