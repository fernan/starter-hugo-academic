abstract: Differentially expressed genes are the hallmark of the specialized biology
  of each life cycle stage. The aim of this work was to identify genes expressed in
  the trypomastigote stage (a blood-circulating stage that invades new cells and spreads
  the infection in different organs of the mammalian host) that could be used to develop
  new vaccines or diagnostics. An initial screening of trypomastigote transcripts
  was performed by sequencing of an epimastigote-subtracted trypomastigote cDNA library.
  Besides identifying a large proportion of differentially expressed mRNAs, we discovered
  a novel protein family, which we denominated TcTASV.
