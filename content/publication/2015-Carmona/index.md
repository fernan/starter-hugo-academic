abstract: Complete characterization of antibody specificities associated to natural
  infections is expected to provide a rich source of serologic biomarkers with potential
  applications in molecular diagnosis, follow-up of chemotherapeutic treatments, and
  prioritization of targets for vaccine development. Here, we developed a highly-multiplexed
  platform based on next-generation high-density peptide microarrays to map these
  specificities in Chagas Disease, an exemplar of a human infectious disease caused
  by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. As a proof of principle in this publication
  we show the designed of a high-density peptide microarray containing >175,000 overlapping
  15mer peptides derived from 457 T. cruzi proteins. Screening of these slides with
  antibodies purified from infected patients and healthy donors demonstrated both
  a high technical reproducibility as well as epitope mapping consistency when compared
  with earlier low-throughput technologies. The power of high-density peptide chips
  for the discovery of pathogen-specific linear B-cell epitopes from clinical samples,
  hence set the stage for high-throughput biomarker discovery screenings and proteome-wide
  studies of immune responses against pathogens.
