abstract: American Trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease is a prevalent, neglected and
  serious debilitating illness caused by the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Trypanosoma
  cruzi. The current chemotherapy is limited only to nifurtimox and benznidazole,
  two drugs that have poor efficacy in the chronic phase and are rather toxic. In
  this scenario, more efficacious and safer drugs, preferentially acting through a
  different mechanism of action and directed against novel targets, are particularly
  welcome. Cruzipain, the main papain-like cysteine peptidase of T. cruzi, is an important
  virulence factor and a chemotherapeutic target with excellent pre-clinical validation
  evidence. Here, we present the identification of new Cruzipain inhibitory scaffolds
  within the GlaxoSmithKline HAT (Human African Trypanosomiasis) and Chagas chemical
  boxes, two collections grouping 404 non-cytotoxic compounds with high antiparasitic
  potency, drug-likeness, structural diversity and scientific novelty. We have adapted
  a continuous enzymatic assay to a medium-throughput format and carried out a primary
  screening of both collections, followed by construction and analysis of dose-response
  curves of the most promising hits. Using the identified compounds as a starting
  point a substructure directed search against CHEMBL Database revealed plausible
  common scaffolds while docking experiments predicted binding poses and specific
  interactions between Cruzipain and the novel inhibitors.
