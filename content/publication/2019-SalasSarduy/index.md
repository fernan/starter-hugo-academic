abstract: In recent years, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced the
  disclosure of small collections of antiparasitic compounds to facilitate research
  and drug development for three of the main Tropical Neglected Diseases- i.e. Human
  African Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis and Chagas Disease. These collections include
  new chemical entities with potential novel mechanisms of action that are likely
  to be active against a wide variety of targets. Taking advantage of these open access
  molecules, we successfully set up medium-throughput screening assays to find the
  first inhibitors of two metallocarboxypeptidases of the M32 family, a group of proteolytic
  enzymes proposed to play several roles in the biology of trypanosomatids including
  peptide catabolism, maintenance of parasite adaptive fitness and hydrolysis of bioactive
  peptides from the human host.
