abstract: The volume of biological, chemical and functional data deposited in the
  public domain is growing rapidly, thanks to next generation sequencing and highly-automated
  screening technologies. These datasets represent invaluable resources for drug discovery,
  particularly for less studied neglected disease pathogens. To leverage these datasets,
  smart and intensive data integration is required to guide computational inferences
  across diverse organisms. We developed the TDR Targets chemogenomics resource to
  integrate genomic data from human pathogens and model organisms along with information
  on bioactive compounds and their annotated activities. In this report we highlight
  the latest updates on the available data and functionality in TDR Targets 6. Based
  on chemogenomic network models providing links between inhibitors and targets, the
  database now incorporates network-driven target prioritizations, and novel visualizations
  of network subgraphs displaying chemical- and target-similarity neighborhoods along
  with associated target-compound bioactivity links. Available data can be browsed
  and queried through a new user interface, that allow users to perform prioritizations
  of protein targets and chemical inhibitors. As such, the database now facilitates
  the investigation of drug repurposing against pathogen targets, which can potentially
  help in identifying candidate targets for bioactive compounds with previously unknown
  targets. TDR Targets is available at https://tdrtargets.org.
