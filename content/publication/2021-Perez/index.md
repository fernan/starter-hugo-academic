abstract: A common strategy to identify new antiparasitic agents is the targeting
  of proteases, due to their essential contributions to parasite growth and development.
  Metacaspases (MCAs) are cysteine proteases present in fungi, protozoa, and plants.
  These enzymes, which are associated with crucial cellular events in trypanosomes,
  are absent in the human host, thus arising as attractive drug targets. To find new
  MCA inhibitors with trypanocidal activity, we adapted a continuous fluorescence
  enzymatic assay to a medium-throughput format and carried out screening of different
  compound collections, followed by the construction of dose-response curves for the
  most promising hits. We used MCA5 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbMCA5) as a model for
  the identification of inhibitors from the GlaxoSmithKline HAT and CHAGAS chemical
  boxes. We also assessed a third collection of nine compounds from the Maybridge
  database that had been identified by virtual screening as potential inhibitors of
  the cysteine peptidase falcipain-2 (clan CA) from Plasmodium falciparum Compound
  HTS01959 (from the Maybridge collection) was the most potent inhibitor, with a 50%
  inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 14.39 µM; it also inhibited other MCAs from T.
  brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi (TbMCA2, 4.14 µM; TbMCA3, 5.04 µM; TcMCA5, 151 µM).
  HTS01959 behaved as a reversible, slow-binding, and noncompetitive inhibitor of
  TbMCA2, with a mechanism of action that included redox components. Importantly,
  HTS01959 displayed trypanocidal activity against bloodstream forms of T. brucei
  and trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, without cytotoxic effects on Vero cells. Thus,
  HTS01959 is a promising starting point to develop more specific and potent chemical
  structures to target MCAs.
