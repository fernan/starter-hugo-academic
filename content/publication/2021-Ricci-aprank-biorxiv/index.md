abstract: 'Availability of highly parallelized immunoassays has renewed interest in
  the discovery of serology biomarkers for infectious diseases. Protein and peptide
  microarrays now provide a rapid, high-throughput platform for immunological testing
  and validation of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes. However, there is still
  a need for tools to prioritize and select relevant probes when designing these arrays.
  In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein
  and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize antigenic
  targets in a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization,
  presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure,
  transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We applied
  this method to prioritize potentially antigenic proteins and peptides in a number
  of bacteria and protozoa causing human diseases: Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease),
  Brucella melitensis (Brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Escherichia coli
  (Gastroenteritis), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), Leishmania braziliensis (Leishmaniasis),
  Leptospira interrogans (Leptospirosis), Mycobacterium leprae (Leprae), Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis (Tuberculosis), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Porphyromonas gingivalis
  (Periodontal disease), Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteremia), Streptococcus pyogenes
  (Group A Streptococcal infections), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis) and Trypanosoma
  cruzi (Chagas Disease). We have tested this integrative method using non-parametric
  ROC-curves and made an unbiased validation using an independent data set. We found
  that APRANK is successful in predicting antigenicity for all pathogen species tested,
  facilitating the production of antigen-enriched protein subsets. We make APRANK
  available to facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic antigens in infectious
  diseases.'
